# Apple-store-Apps-Analysis

This project is a collaboration from @gradmahey and Adesewa using MS Excel for the data analysis.

We wanted to learn about apps in both playstore and ios stores, what apps are people downloading and using and if possible why.

There are some insights we got from exploring the data that'll help any organisation who wants to build apps for the people to know exactly which apps they can invest in to get a good return on investment. Both free and Paid versions.
